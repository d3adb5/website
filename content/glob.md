Here you will find ponderances, ideas, cool things I found, plans I'll likely
never execute, and other things that don't quite fit elsewhere on the website
nor warrant a full article. Consider it the *more personal, human, and
admittedly ugly* side of this website.

To those used to the technical writing found elsewhere on this website, this
may present a stark contrast.

Believe it or not, I found this gem while watching [meeting #131][oggo-131] of
the (2nd session) 44th Canadian Parliament's Standing Committee on Government
Operations and Estimated (OGGO). You can read the [minutes of
proceedings][oggo-131-mins] if you prefer text. It led me to [this really nice
article][sutherland-rol] about the rule of law by the Sutherland Institute,
too, that I think is worth a read.

[The powerful scene this is from is on YouTube.][amas-devil]

While looking for the lyrics to 優しい嘘 (Yasashii Uso) by 上原れな (Uehara
Rena), I ended up finding a [Smule][smule] page for it. On it, there were a few
[recordings of people singing the song][recordings] submitted years ago. These
are very sweet amateur renditions of the song, and I found myself smiling like
a parent listening to their children's school recital.

[This one might be my favorite.][wa2-rec]

I made it so I can enable MathJax on a per-page basis on this website. It's
really cool to be able to write mathematical notation. I used to use Pandoc to
convert Markdown with inlined LaTeX to PDF for notes and assignments back in
university, so this is a nice throwback to those days.

Look at it:

$$
\mathbbm{E}(X) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} x \cdot \mathbbm{P}(x)
\longrightarrow
\mathbbm{E}(f(X)) = \sum_{y \in f(\mathcal{X})} y \cdot \mathbbm{P}(y)
$$

Not that it'll get much meaningful use, but it's nice to have the option.

*To the person with whom I recently reconnected,*

I doubt you are reading this. If anything, I hope you aren't, for I've gone out
of my way to avoid linking my different online presences together. However, if
for whatever reason you scoured the Internet looking for me and stumbled upon
this website, know that I appreciate the effort and find it endearing.

Reconnecting with you has been a bittersweet experience. I did tell you this,
but more than reconnecting with you, it feels like I am reconnecting with
someone I used to be. Life has changed me in many ways, some for the better,
some for the worse. I'm at a strange point where I'm not entirely sure what
direction to take, and speaking to you has thrown me into a tailspin of
nostalgia and introspection.

I'm glad I sent you that text. *I'm happy that you replied,* and it still
surprises me how friendly you were to me after everything that transpired and
the time that has passed. I hope we can keep in touch, even if only
sporadically. You were an important part of my life once, and I'd like to be a
part of yours again, even if only as a distant acquaintance.

Only time will tell where this leads us. For now, I want to express what I
won't bother texting you in short bursts:

- Your website inspired this page. Sorry I copied the idea, it was *precisely*
  what I was looking for.
- Your writing style remains something I admire. Thank you for publishing so
  many of your thoughts.
- Life is difficult and complicated. I'm sorry for the hardships you've
  endured.
- It's refreshing to see how much individuality you've retained and developed.
- The records of our past interactions bring a smile to my face, and have given
  me motivation to preserve history.

I really liked you, y'know? You may not have thought me sincere, but I was.
