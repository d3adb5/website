Hey there, reader! I wonder how you found your way here. Welcome to my humble
abode here on this [series of tubes][tubes]. Hopefully your mail doesn't get
held up because of me.

I am but a simple software developer, lover of languages, fan of  _The Legend of
Zelda_, and admirer of fried chicken. Among the things that motivate me you'll
find _free software_, some _functional programming_, a little bit of
_mathematics_, and a **mean** steak with fries on the side.

This website will house some of my scattered thoughts, references to things I
find interesting, and perhaps in the future a gallery of sorts for people to
take a look at. It's not meant as a portfolio, but if you happen to like the
look of these pages, know that I [made it all myself.][repo]

## How to reach me

If you want to reach me for whatever reason, you can send me an email. The
domain you used to get here, if any, preceded by `me@`, should lead your message
straight to my inbox. Please be nice.

Encryption is something I do enjoy. You can find my public PGP keys through the
following IDs:

```
ECC: 1D6680F97A6617F4D9B2A0F9D989443FD3ADB5C7
RSA: C3295D9E3A719FFE2EFD2EBB697797CED3ADB5C9
