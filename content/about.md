Bear with me as I struggle to write something meaningful here. I believe no
amount of prose, poetry or illustrations can truly capture the essence of a
person, and invite you to contact me if you wish to connect on a deeper level.
_In fact, I'd be elated if you did,_ as I find it unbearably difficult to
bridge the gap between myself and others.

Here is a bullet list of quick facts for you to skim through if you don't feel
like reading everything:

- The way I type resembles the pages on this website. It's not everyone's cup
  of tea, but it's authentic to who I am.
- Social interactions are often draining for me. Consequently, I cling to
  meaningful relationships and avoid superficial ones.
- Since childhood, I've held a curiosity not limited to an understanding of the
  natural world, but also of people and their motivations.
- I love it when simplicity meets elegance: a story told eloquently in a few
  words, a minimal yet functional workspace, a fun game with simple mechanics
  and no overwhelming interface.

This website is a successor to an older one I had, which was much more personal
than this one has been up until the time of writing this. Looking back, I see a
lot of myself in those pages, and I now wish to recreate that feeling here.
Despite the more professional early tone of this site, I want it to still feel
like _me._

## Interests

Here's a non-exhaustive list, in no particular order:

- Excercising dialectics, pushing others to question their own beliefs and
  assumptions, playing devil's advocate.
- Declarative approaches to programming, system administration, and
  infrastructure.
- Languages and linguistics, particularly phonetics and etymology.
- GNU/Linux and free software, and the philosophy behind the latter.
- Consuming media (e.g. movies, series, books) with others and discussing them
  afterwards.

The last one is particularly important to me. I find that sharing experiences
is the best way to bond with others, and that analyzing and discussing the
things we encounter helps us appreciate them more deeply. In the process, we'll
come to understand one another and the world around us better, little by
little. *It would make me happy if you came to cherish the things I love,* and
vice versa.
