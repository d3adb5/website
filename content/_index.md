Yeah, I know, my username looks pretty "l33t", and it was somewhat randomly
generated.

There's not a lot to see here, but feel free to look around. Hopefully there's
something of use to you on this website. I'll write about whatever comes to mind
_as_ it comes to mind, so if my words read like scattered thoughts, they
probably are.

The website is a constant work in progress. I'm not a front-end developer, never
will be. All I can really give you are pages without kilograms of JavaScript on
them.

## Source code, generation, hosting, etc.

The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages][ghpages], and the pages are generated
through [Hugo][hugo]. You can find the entire source code, including the GitHub
Actions workflow that publishes it to the `gh-pages` branch on [this
repository][ghrepo] on GitHub.

You can find repositories on [my GitHub profile][ghprofile] for other projects
of mine, be it silly things I've decided to put up online against my better
judgment or genuine work that I've put up online for people to use.

I try to make contributions to some of the projects that I use personally. One
of those is [xmonad/xmonad-contrib][ghxmcontrib], the repository containing user
submitted modules for use with [XMonad][ghxmonad], the purely functional window
manager for X11 written in Haskell. It's nice to think changes I've made, even
entire modules, are in use by other XMonad users.

## What can I expect to see on this site?

Hopefully some tutorials, ramblings, and real life cases that I think bear some
relevance and could be the source of insight for other like minded people. For
example, it's no mystery that I like Git. This website is versioned with Git,
and _there will always be a link in the page footer to the last commit_ that
changed the page you are looking at. If you like Git, perhaps you'll find that
pretty cool!

I'll do my best to make these pages available in multiple languages, both as a
way to practice them and as a way to reach more people through them. If it all
goes according to plan, other people will be helping me out by reviewing the
different versions of the content in other languages.
