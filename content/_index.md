Welcome! There's not much to see here, and I wonder if there ever will be much
to see, but you're free to stick around for as long as you like.

This entire site is a work in progress. I'm not a front-end web developer, so
don't expect a shiny, sophisticated website with kilograms of JavaScript and CSS
that make your CPU work as hard as it can to render every little character you
see on the screen. Instead, expect it to be barebones, almost like handmade
HTML.

Yes, I'm using a monospace font. I like it. It's cute.
