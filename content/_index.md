I know, looks pretty "l33t", and it was somewhat randomly generated.

There's not a lot to see here, but feel free to look around. Hopefully there's
something of use to you on this website. I'll write about whatever comes to mind
_as_ it comes to mind, so if my words read like scattered thoughts, they
probably are.

The website is a constant work in progress. I'm not a front-end developer, never
will be. All I can really give you are pages without kilograms of JavaScript on
them.

## source, hosting, etc.

The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages][ghpages], and the pages are generated
through [Hugo][hugo]. You can find the entire source code, including the GitHub
Actions workflow that publishes it to the `gh-pages` branch on [this
repository][ghrepo].
