Do you ever feel so inclined to share something that you seek out the company
of others, only to realize you have nothing to say to them once you've found
them? Little thoughts that flit through your mind and beg to be manifested into
words, yet lack a willing audience to receive them and sadly dissipate as
quickly as they came. *I feel that is a common affliction:* a symptom of a self
that yearns to connect with others on a deeper level, but is constrained by
often self-imposed barriers.

It helps to have not just an outlet, but a curated record of what one wants to
say. A place to return to, to connect with oneself over time, and for others to
connect with you as well. Not a public journal or diary, but a place you build
yourself so personally that others are wont to say it "screams you." **To me,
this is that place.**

## Forever a work in progress

Much like myself, this website is constantly evolving --- and doing so slowly.
You can navigate it through the section links at the top, but there are also
[some extra pages][extra] that don't fit anywhere else on the site. The latest
updates will be listed below as Git commits, and there will be a link to the
latest relevant commit for each page on the page footer.
