Do you ever feel a strange sadness when trying to share something with others?
A longing for connection accompanied by an inability to express oneself fully.
Perhaps you work up the courage to open a chat window with a friend, but get
stuck composing and rewriting a message, unable to submit a single word, for
fear they won't care or understand. You want to record your thoughts, but a
journal feels too private, and social media too public.

You crave a space that is yours alone, where you aren't a drop in an ocean of
shapeless voices competing for deciseconds of attention. Not an outlet, per se,
but a curated record of what you once wanted to say. A place you can return to,
to connect with yourself over time, and where others can connect with you as
well. **To me, this is that place.**

## Forever a work in progress

Much like myself, this website is constantly evolving --- and doing so slowly.
You can navigate it through the section links at the top, but there are also
[some extra pages][extra] that don't fit anywhere else on the site. The latest
updates will be listed below as Git commits, and there will be a link to the
latest relevant commit for each page on the page footer.
