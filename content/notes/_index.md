People often say that the best way to commit something to memory is by writing
it over. Maybe it's because even if you don't understand what you're writing
down, muscle memory will help you remember the words, and teachers equate their
students' grades with their own self-worth. Another common saying is that the
best way to learn something is by teaching it to others.

I'll make no claim to either of these being true. This section exists so I can
force myself to type things out and to fill my website's Git repository with
commits. My notebooks were never well organized, so _abandon all hope, ye who
enter here._
