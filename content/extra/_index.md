_Welcome to the extended menu!_ This is where pages that don't fit elsewhere on
the website or have simply been forgotten end up. Small pages that don't deserve
a spot on the main navigation bar, discontinued sections and forgotten drafts,
pages can end up here for a variety of reasons. This doesn't mean they're bad,
they just belong with the other misfits.

## [My impossible list]({{< relref "impossible.md" >}})

A list of personal challenges and goals that evolves as life goes on. A type of
evolving bucket list, according to [Joel Runyon.][impossible] Should be updated
as I complete items on the list and add new ones. Hopefully it lives up to the
original definition of an impossible list.

## [Notes, a public notebook]({{< relref "notes" >}})

**Dead as of 2023-05-06,** this section was supposed to contain some study notes
and other useful information on things I was learning. I found it preferable to
write articles to the [blog section][blog] instead. Nevertheless, the bit of
text I wrote is still here if you want to read it.
