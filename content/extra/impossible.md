subtitle: A meaningful, evolving bucket list

This is a list of challenges and goals I've set for myself, to be updated and
documented as I live my life. The concept is supposed to follow what [Joel
Runyon][impossible] called an impossible list. I came across the concept from
someone's personal website, but have since forgotten where. If you care about
me at all, grill me about updating this list if you can.
