and font rendering engines made me lose a few hours of my life. Of course, I
consider myself equally guilty, for my choices and stubbornness inevitably led
to the happenings I am about to relay onto you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a dark and stormy night somewhere in the world. I was sitting in front
of my laptop, speaking to a couple of friends over Mumble, when I accidentally
&lt;em&gt;knocked over the glass of soda&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;d just fetched from the kitchen. It would
have been a minor inconvenience, had I not &lt;em&gt;spilled it directly onto my
laptop.&lt;/em&gt; In a panic, I told my friends I&amp;rsquo;d be back later and immediately shut
the system down to avoid any short circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
