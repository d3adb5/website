beta version of Netscape, and later as &lt;em&gt;JavaScript,&lt;/em&gt; presumably as a marketing
ploy to capitalize on the rising popularity of &lt;em&gt;Java.&lt;/em&gt; Its goal was to make it
so webpages wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be static paintings users scrolled through, but rather
interactive experiences that could react to user input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a noble pursuit in many ways. &lt;strong&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re talking about 1995&lt;/strong&gt; here, when
the Web was so young CSS hadn&amp;rsquo;t even been implemented yet &amp;mdash; the first version
of CSS was implemented in 1996! In fact, if like me you were thinking &amp;ldquo;there
was already user interactivity in HTML through Web forms&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;d be wrong:
official support for the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags was only added to HTML in
November 1995 &amp;mdash; in version 2.0 of the HTML standard &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;two months after
LiveScript,&lt;/em&gt; and just a month before its rename and official stable release.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
