Management Software&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. GitLab CI already existed &amp;mdash; it was first
created in 2012 &amp;mdash; but it was only years later that GitLab started to market
itself as a &amp;ldquo;DevOps platform&amp;rdquo;, pushing products that span the entirety of the
software development lifecycle, from planning to deployment. So how good is
their pipeline offering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitLab CI is GitLab&amp;rsquo;s built-in pipeline system. It&amp;rsquo;s a CI/CD tool that allows
you to define workflows for building, testing, and deploying software from
GitLab by adding a &lt;code&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/code&gt; file to the root of the repository and
ensuring there is an available runner to pick the job up. These could be hosted
by GitLab or by the user, and they come in a variety of flavors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
