on her Nintendo Switch OLED. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching her play, and it rekindled my
interest in the game in a way that I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing video
games on and off since I was a kid, but honestly believed that I was done with
them. However, watching her play the game and seeing how much she enjoys it, I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t help grabbing my Switch and continuing from where I left off.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Some of my thoughts on The Legend of Zelda</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/thoughts-on-zelda-games/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/thoughts-on-zelda-games/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;rsquo;t spend a lot of my time playing video games, there are a few
franchises that will compell me to spend some of my spare hours in front of a
screen (or two). For the most part they are Nintendo franchises, but they also
feature &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Puyo Puyo Tetris.&lt;/em&gt; The series that never fails to
draw me in, however, is &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda,&lt;/em&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about
briefly in this article.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
