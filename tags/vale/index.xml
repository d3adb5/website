The
way I discovered it was by going through &lt;a href="https://stakater.com"&gt;Stakater&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s public
repositories on GitHub. More specifically the &lt;a href="https://github.com/stakater/vocabulary"&gt;stakater/vocabulary&lt;/a&gt;
repository, which contains a &lt;a href="https://vale.sh/docs/topics/vocab/"&gt;Vale vocabulary&lt;/a&gt; for Vale&amp;rsquo;s spell
checker not to yell at them for using Kubernetes resource names in prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge fan of tools that judge my writing, I do feel there are
some recurrent typos I could eliminate without need for a code review prior to
merging a new article to this website. And so I have decided to try out Vale
when I&amp;rsquo;m writing new pages and blog posts like this one. As a bonus that comes
with my Vale configuration, I get information on text readability, among other
things.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
