extensive use of Helm. It is known by some as the Kubernetes package manager,
so you&amp;rsquo;ll naturally use it as you deploy applications to your cluster. Other
than release management, its main advantage is generating resources based on
user configurable &lt;em&gt;values.&lt;/em&gt; Conditionals are a direct evolution of that, and
loops come into play as need be. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Implementing the Blue/Green deployment strategy with Helm</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/blue-green-with-helm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/blue-green-with-helm/</guid><description>&lt;section class="dialog dialog-info"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/strong&gt; Heed the warning in this article&amp;rsquo;s subtitle. Use the &lt;a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/"&gt;right
tool for the job,&lt;/a&gt; this is just for fun. Well, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just
for fun in the beginning, but now that I did it and found a better alternative
that fits my use case, it became just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better or for worse, one of the principal tools for any developer or
operator using Kubernetes is &lt;a href="https://helm.sh/"&gt;Helm.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful tool for sure, but
it uses Go templates, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the most intuitive syntax. On top of
that, there are some weird decisions made by the developers of the tool &amp;mdash;
semantic versioning is a requirement for chart versions, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
