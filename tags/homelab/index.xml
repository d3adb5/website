This
is perhaps the most crucial part of a complete homelab setup, as without
storage you are very limited in what you can do that is useful. Essentially I
wanted expandable, reliable, and moderately fast storage that could be accessed
by all the nodes in my Talos cluster. Turns out I had to give up a bit of high
availability to get there, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Talos Linux Homelab Pt. 2: Cluster and Argo CD Bootstrapping</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/talos-homelab-pt-2-cluster-bootstrapping/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/talos-homelab-pt-2-cluster-bootstrapping/</guid><description>&lt;section class="dialog dialog-warning"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began writing this article about a year ago. Some of the content may be
outdated and I&amp;rsquo;m now hazy on the details. An attempt was made to keep it
accurate, but note that this was never meant to be a tutorial or a step-by-step
guide.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; meant as a replacement for the Talos documentation page
on &lt;a href="https://www.talos.dev/v1.9/introduction/getting-started/"&gt;getting started with a cluster&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll just mention what
I&amp;rsquo;ve done and how easy it is to set it up, as well as the steps that I took to
set up Argo CD and an App of Apps repository. For reference, the repository I
ended up with is available on GitHub under &lt;a href="https://github.com/d3adb5/homelab"&gt;d3adb5/homelab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Talos Linux Homelab Pt. 1: An introduction</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/assembling-a-homelab-part-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/assembling-a-homelab-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There comes a time in a technology enthusiast&amp;rsquo;s life when they decide to build
a homelab. Chances are if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, you&amp;rsquo;ve either googled the term
and know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about &amp;mdash; so I promise not to take long in this
introduction &amp;mdash; or you&amp;rsquo;re following me (stalking much?) and don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily
care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I&amp;rsquo;ve long had &lt;em&gt;VPSes&lt;/em&gt; to host my personal projects and services
like Plex for myself and close friends. It&amp;rsquo;s always seemed much cheaper than
purchasing the equipment and hosting on-premises. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve even set up a
Kubernetes cluster using &lt;a href="https://k0sproject.io/"&gt;k0s, a Kubernetes distribution&lt;/a&gt; made to be
simple and lightweight. Latency, bandwidth limits and weak hardware have
compelled me to build one instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
