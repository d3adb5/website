some graphically demanding PC games. The plan had existed for a while, but was
accelerated after I broke my Arch Linux installation on my Dell Optiplex 3080
Micro &amp;mdash; I blogged about it previously &amp;mdash; and decided I needed to ensure I
had backup installations and SSDs to fall back onto in times of need. In this
article I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sonos speakers are actually pretty good</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/sonos-speakers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/sonos-speakers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last Christmas I got my wife a couple of Sonos One speakers so she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
have to listen to music through her phone&amp;rsquo;s tiny speaker. She does have a good
pair of headphones, and the audio quality of AirPods is decent enough I&amp;rsquo;m in no
hurry to replace any of those. However, when we listen to music together over a
game of &lt;em&gt;Scrabble&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bananagrams,&lt;/em&gt; iPhone or iPad speakers simply won&amp;rsquo;t cut
it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How does a micro form factor PC perform?</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/using-a-micro-pc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/using-a-micro-pc/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, I started looking into building myself a reasonable desktop
so I could finally graduate from my ThinkPad X220. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, the X220
is pretty neat and will still work for a long time, but sometimes its fan would
go turbo mode while running relatively simple programs like Telegram Desktop
and Discord. You could chalk that up to the applications not being well
optimized &lt;em&gt;&amp;mdash; and that is specially true for the latter example &amp;mdash;&lt;/em&gt; but at
some point you give in and start looking to replace the hardware that was
already meant for just office work &lt;strong&gt;when it came out back in 2011.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
