This
is perhaps the most crucial part of a complete homelab setup, as without
storage you are very limited in what you can do that is useful. Essentially I
wanted expandable, reliable, and moderately fast storage that could be accessed
by all the nodes in my Talos cluster. Turns out I had to give up a bit of high
availability to get there, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Talos Linux Homelab Pt. 2: Cluster and Argo CD Bootstrapping</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/talos-homelab-pt-2-cluster-bootstrapping/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/talos-homelab-pt-2-cluster-bootstrapping/</guid><description>&lt;section class="dialog dialog-warning"&gt;

 &lt;section class="dialog-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began writing this article about a year ago. Some of the content may be
outdated and I&amp;rsquo;m now hazy on the details. An attempt was made to keep it
accurate, but note that this was never meant to be a tutorial or a step-by-step
guide.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; meant as a replacement for the Talos documentation page
on &lt;a href="https://www.talos.dev/v1.9/introduction/getting-started/"&gt;getting started with a cluster&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll just mention what
I&amp;rsquo;ve done and how easy it is to set it up, as well as the steps that I took to
set up Argo CD and an App of Apps repository. For reference, the repository I
ended up with is available on GitHub under &lt;a href="https://github.com/d3adb5/homelab"&gt;d3adb5/homelab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Talos Linux Homelab Pt. 1: An introduction</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/assembling-a-homelab-part-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/assembling-a-homelab-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There comes a time in a technology enthusiast&amp;rsquo;s life when they decide to build
a homelab. Chances are if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, you&amp;rsquo;ve either googled the term
and know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about &amp;mdash; so I promise not to take long in this
introduction &amp;mdash; or you&amp;rsquo;re following me (stalking much?) and don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily
care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I&amp;rsquo;ve long had &lt;em&gt;VPSes&lt;/em&gt; to host my personal projects and services
like Plex for myself and close friends. It&amp;rsquo;s always seemed much cheaper than
purchasing the equipment and hosting on-premises. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve even set up a
Kubernetes cluster using &lt;a href="https://k0sproject.io/"&gt;k0s, a Kubernetes distribution&lt;/a&gt; made to be
simple and lightweight. Latency, bandwidth limits and weak hardware have
compelled me to build one instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On excessive templating with Helm</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/on-helm-templates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/on-helm-templates/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in other blogposts that I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in a project making
extensive use of Helm. It is known by some as the Kubernetes package manager,
so you&amp;rsquo;ll naturally use it as you deploy applications to your cluster. Other
than release management, its main advantage is generating resources based on
user configurable &lt;em&gt;values.&lt;/em&gt; Conditionals are a direct evolution of that, and
loops come into play as need be. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Implementing the Blue/Green deployment strategy with Helm</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/blue-green-with-helm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/blue-green-with-helm/</guid><description>&lt;section class="dialog dialog-info"&gt;
 &lt;section class="dialog-icon"&gt;ℹ️&lt;/section&gt;
 &lt;section class="dialog-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/strong&gt; Heed the warning in this article&amp;rsquo;s subtitle. Use the &lt;a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/"&gt;right
tool for the job,&lt;/a&gt; this is just for fun. Well, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just
for fun in the beginning, but now that I did it and found a better alternative
that fits my use case, it became just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better or for worse, one of the principal tools for any developer or
operator using Kubernetes is &lt;a href="https://helm.sh/"&gt;Helm.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful tool for sure, but
it uses Go templates, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the most intuitive syntax. On top of
that, there are some weird decisions made by the developers of the tool &amp;mdash;
semantic versioning is a requirement for chart versions, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
