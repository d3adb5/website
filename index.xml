&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;glob()&lt;/code&gt; function searches for all the pathnames matching pattern
according to the rules used by the shell (see &lt;code&gt;glob(7)&lt;/code&gt;). No tilde expansion
or parameter substitution is done; if you want these, use &lt;code&gt;word‐exp(3)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you will find ponderances, ideas, cool things I found, plans I&amp;rsquo;ll likely
never execute, and other assorted bits and pieces that don&amp;rsquo;t quite fit
elsewhere on the website nor are lengthy enough to warrant a full article.
Consider it the &lt;em&gt;more personal, human, and admittedly ugly&lt;/em&gt; side of my writing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Talos Linux Homelab Pt. 3: Storage Solutions</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/talos-homelab-pt-3-truenas-storage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/talos-homelab-pt-3-truenas-storage/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The last thing I&amp;rsquo;ll cover in this series &lt;em&gt;for the time being&lt;/em&gt; is storage. This
is perhaps the most crucial part of a complete homelab setup, as without
storage you are very limited in what you can do that is useful. Essentially I
wanted expandable, reliable, and moderately fast storage that could be accessed
by all the nodes in my Talos cluster. Turns out I had to give up a bit of high
availability to get there, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Talos Linux Homelab Pt. 2: Cluster and Argo CD Bootstrapping</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/talos-homelab-pt-2-cluster-bootstrapping/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/talos-homelab-pt-2-cluster-bootstrapping/</guid><description>&lt;section class="dialog dialog-warning"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began writing this article about a year ago. Some of the content may be
outdated and I&amp;rsquo;m now hazy on the details. An attempt was made to keep it
accurate, but note that this was never meant to be a tutorial or a step-by-step
guide.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; meant as a replacement for the Talos documentation page
on &lt;a href="https://www.talos.dev/v1.9/introduction/getting-started/"&gt;getting started with a cluster&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll just mention what
I&amp;rsquo;ve done and how easy it is to set it up, as well as the steps that I took to
set up Argo CD and an App of Apps repository. For reference, the repository I
ended up with is available on GitHub under &lt;a href="https://github.com/d3adb5/homelab"&gt;d3adb5/homelab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Talos Linux Homelab Pt. 1: An introduction</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/assembling-a-homelab-part-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/assembling-a-homelab-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There comes a time in a technology enthusiast&amp;rsquo;s life when they decide to build
a homelab. Chances are if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, you&amp;rsquo;ve either googled the term
and know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about &amp;mdash; so I promise not to take long in this
introduction &amp;mdash; or you&amp;rsquo;re following me (stalking much?) and don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily
care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I&amp;rsquo;ve long had &lt;em&gt;VPSes&lt;/em&gt; to host my personal projects and services
like Plex for myself and close friends. It&amp;rsquo;s always seemed much cheaper than
purchasing the equipment and hosting on-premises. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve even set up a
Kubernetes cluster using &lt;a href="https://k0sproject.io/"&gt;k0s, a Kubernetes distribution&lt;/a&gt; made to be
simple and lightweight. Latency, bandwidth limits and weak hardware have
compelled me to build one instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building myself a desktop PC</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/building-a-computer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/building-a-computer/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This year I decided to build myself a computer, and use it to start playing
some graphically demanding PC games. The plan had existed for a while, but was
accelerated after I broke my Arch Linux installation on my Dell Optiplex 3080
Micro &amp;mdash; I blogged about it previously &amp;mdash; and decided I needed to ensure I
had backup installations and SSDs to fall back onto in times of need. In this
article I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Breaking and unbreaking my Arch installation</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/breaking-my-system/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/breaking-my-system/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I somehow managed to break my Arch Linux installation
through a simple &lt;code&gt;pacman -Syu&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure what caused it, but after a
quite normal package update, I rebooted the system and was met with a message
stating something along these lines, before I could even input my LUKS
passphrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Failed to execute /bin/init (No such file or directory)

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the kernel image was loaded and was trying to load an init system,
this was likely a problem with the &lt;em&gt;initramfs.&lt;/em&gt; For the unitiated, the &lt;em&gt;initial
RAM filesystem,&lt;/em&gt; also known as &lt;em&gt;initrd,&lt;/em&gt; for &amp;ldquo;initial ramdisk,&amp;rdquo; is a temporary
file system that is loaded into memory during the boot process, to prepare the
system before the init system is loaded.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Thoughts on GitLab CI</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/gitlab-cicd-opinions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/gitlab-cicd-opinions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the landing page for GitLab.com described GitLab as &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130403093627/http://www.gitlab.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Source Git
Management Software&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. GitLab CI already existed &amp;mdash; it was first
created in 2012 &amp;mdash; but it was only years later that GitLab started to market
itself as a &amp;ldquo;DevOps platform&amp;rdquo;, pushing products that span the entirety of the
software development lifecycle, from planning to deployment. So how good is
their pipeline offering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitLab CI is GitLab&amp;rsquo;s built-in pipeline system. It&amp;rsquo;s a CI/CD tool that allows
you to define workflows for building, testing, and deploying software from
GitLab by adding a &lt;code&gt;.gitlab-ci.yml&lt;/code&gt; file to the root of the repository and
ensuring there is an available runner to pick the job up. These could be hosted
by GitLab or by the user, and they come in a variety of flavors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why are Ruby blocks constructed like this?</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/somebody-please-explain-vagrant-ruby/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/somebody-please-explain-vagrant-ruby/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I took up a position with a new company that involves the use of SaltStack.
Since I&amp;rsquo;d never used it before, I decided to try my hand at setting up a proof
of concept, and for that I wanted to use multiple machines. So I decided to use
Vagrant, another tool I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with, to declaratively spin up a few
VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I first tried:&lt;/p&gt;

automatically settings up DNS resolution for the machine&amp;rsquo;s friendly names. I
noticed that the hostnames of my machines were sometimes all &lt;code&gt;huron&lt;/code&gt; or all
&lt;code&gt;michigan&lt;/code&gt; or something other than &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;, even though the name of the
machine on the Vagrant side was correct. Then it dawned on me: &lt;em&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s using
whatever the last value of &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; in the loop was!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Was I wrong about JavaScript?</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/javascript-isnt-so-bad/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/javascript-isnt-so-bad/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript was first introduced 27 years ago, initially as &lt;em&gt;LiveScript,&lt;/em&gt; in a
beta version of Netscape, and later as &lt;em&gt;JavaScript,&lt;/em&gt; presumably as a marketing
ploy to capitalize on the rising popularity of &lt;em&gt;Java.&lt;/em&gt; Its goal was to make it
so webpages wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be static paintings users scrolled through, but rather
interactive experiences that could react to user input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a noble pursuit in many ways. &lt;strong&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re talking about 1995&lt;/strong&gt; here, when
the Web was so young CSS hadn&amp;rsquo;t even been implemented yet &amp;mdash; the first version
of CSS was implemented in 1996! In fact, if like me you were thinking &amp;ldquo;there
was already user interactivity in HTML through Web forms&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;d be wrong:
official support for the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags was only added to HTML in
November 1995 &amp;mdash; in version 2.0 of the HTML standard &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;two months after
LiveScript,&lt;/em&gt; and just a month before its rename and official stable release.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How a keyboard layout ruined my daily life</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/unusual-keyboard-shenanigans/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/unusual-keyboard-shenanigans/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using computers for quite some time.

programmers who complained about the language were just too lazy to deal with

worked on, in one way or another, that I think are worthy of some note. I&amp;rsquo;ll
add descriptions for each project, or for my involvement in it if it&amp;rsquo;s not
originally mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; projects on &lt;em&gt;GitHub!&lt;/em&gt; This will make up most of the
projects listed here, as most free and open source projects are hosted on
GitHub &amp;mdash; for better or for worse &amp;mdash; and that&amp;rsquo;s where I host mine as well.
For each repository, the languages used are listed below the project
description in order of most used to least used. These appear as detected by
GitHub and may not be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chronicles of XMonad and xmobar</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/xmobar-and-xmonad-being-painful/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/xmobar-and-xmonad-being-painful/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a story about how the Haskell toolset, Arch Linux package maintainers,
and font rendering engines made me lose a few hours of my life. Of course, I
consider myself equally guilty, for my choices and stubbornness inevitably led
to the happenings I am about to relay onto you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chapter-1-first-mistakes"&gt;Chapter 1: First Mistakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a dark and stormy night somewhere in the world. I was sitting in front
of my laptop, speaking to a couple of friends over Mumble, when I accidentally
&lt;em&gt;knocked over the glass of soda&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;d just fetched from the kitchen. It would
have been a minor inconvenience, had I not &lt;em&gt;spilled it directly onto my
laptop.&lt;/em&gt; In a panic, I told my friends I&amp;rsquo;d be back later and immediately shut
the system down to avoid any short circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>About me and this website</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/about/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In this page I will try to put my best foot forward and highlight my qualities,
accomplishments, aspirations and goals to you, the reader. This is not out of
some narcissistic need to impress you, but rather to give you a better idea of
what I&amp;rsquo;m about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m a &lt;em&gt;DevOps Engineer&lt;/em&gt; working with various technologies but with a
keen interest in &lt;em&gt;Kubernetes.&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m also a bit of a &lt;em&gt;GNU/Linux enthusiast,&lt;/em&gt;
having been using the operating system for over a decade now. My formal
education is comprised of unfinished bachelors degrees in both &lt;em&gt;Computer
Science&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Abstract Mathematics&lt;/em&gt; at prestigious universities in my home
country.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Experiencing 64 GB of RAM + 80 GB of swap</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/lots-of-ram/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/lots-of-ram/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of days I have been using a machine with &lt;em&gt;64 GB of RAM,&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;80 GB of swap space.&lt;/em&gt; This amount of computer memory is more than I have
ever conceived using. No, &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not gaming on it,&lt;/strong&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;m not a Java
developer running IntelliJ IDEA with 20+ projects open at the same time.
However, language servers and other applications I use on a daily basis have
made me rethink how much memory I really need.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Trying out Vale as a prose linter</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/vale-linter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/vale-linter/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently discovered a linting tool for prose called &lt;a href="https://vale.sh"&gt;Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The
way I discovered it was by going through &lt;a href="https://stakater.com"&gt;Stakater&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s public
repositories on GitHub. More specifically the &lt;a href="https://github.com/stakater/vocabulary"&gt;stakater/vocabulary&lt;/a&gt;
repository, which contains a &lt;a href="https://vale.sh/docs/topics/vocab/"&gt;Vale vocabulary&lt;/a&gt; for Vale&amp;rsquo;s spell
checker not to yell at them for using Kubernetes resource names in prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge fan of tools that judge my writing, I do feel there are
some recurrent typos I could eliminate without need for a code review prior to
merging a new article to this website. And so I have decided to try out Vale
when I&amp;rsquo;m writing new pages and blog posts like this one. As a bonus that comes
with my Vale configuration, I get information on text readability, among other
things.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sonos speakers are actually pretty good</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/sonos-speakers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/sonos-speakers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last Christmas I got my wife a couple of Sonos One speakers so she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
have to listen to music through her phone&amp;rsquo;s tiny speaker. She does have a good
pair of headphones, and the audio quality of AirPods is decent enough I&amp;rsquo;m in no
hurry to replace any of those. However, when we listen to music together over a
game of &lt;em&gt;Scrabble&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bananagrams,&lt;/em&gt; iPhone or iPad speakers simply won&amp;rsquo;t cut
it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Back to playing games because of Breath of the Wild</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/back-to-playing-botw/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/back-to-playing-botw/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My wife has recently started playing &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;
on her Nintendo Switch OLED. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching her play, and it rekindled my
interest in the game in a way that I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing video
games on and off since I was a kid, but honestly believed that I was done with
them. However, watching her play the game and seeing how much she enjoys it, I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t help grabbing my Switch and continuing from where I left off.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Updated Git opinions and lessons learned</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/more-git-opinions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/more-git-opinions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is yet another foray into Git matters. I must say that, albeit not by
much, my opinions have changed since &lt;a href="https://d3adb5.net/blog/git-rebase-vs-merge/"&gt;the last time I wrote down my thoughts on
Git.&lt;/a&gt; While I&amp;rsquo;m still an advocate for linear history &amp;mdash;
provided it doesn&amp;rsquo;t come at considerable expense &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;ve come to revel in my
laziness, appreciate the power of a Git merge, and hold in contempt the
inability of suites like GitLab, GitHub, and BitBucket to handle conflict
resolution in merge commits.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On excessive templating with Helm</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/on-helm-templates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/on-helm-templates/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in other blogposts that I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in a project making
extensive use of Helm. It is known by some as the Kubernetes package manager,
so you&amp;rsquo;ll naturally use it as you deploy applications to your cluster. Other
than release management, its main advantage is generating resources based on
user configurable &lt;em&gt;values.&lt;/em&gt; Conditionals are a direct evolution of that, and
loops come into play as need be. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Prometheus and metrics-based monitoring</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/extra/notes/prometheus/summary/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/extra/notes/prometheus/summary/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Prometheus is an incredibly (the most?) popular tool for monitoring and
alerting, especially in the cloud-native world. It aids in fetching, storing,
and querying metrics from a variety of sources, and can be used to trigger
alerts when certain conditions are met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fancy words, what is it, really?&lt;/em&gt; You can imagine Prometheus as the annoying
little brother or cousing who periodically hits you with the same question, in
anticipation for when you&amp;rsquo;re going out, playing video games, or preparing food.
In this case, this annoying rugrat is asking &amp;ldquo;how much memory are you using?&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;how many requests are you getting?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;how many threads are you running?&amp;rdquo;, and
so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Implementing the Blue/Green deployment strategy with Helm</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/blue-green-with-helm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/blue-green-with-helm/</guid><description>&lt;section class="dialog dialog-info"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/strong&gt; Heed the warning in this article&amp;rsquo;s subtitle. Use the &lt;a href="https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/"&gt;right
tool for the job,&lt;/a&gt; this is just for fun. Well, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just
for fun in the beginning, but now that I did it and found a better alternative
that fits my use case, it became just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better or for worse, one of the principal tools for any developer or
operator using Kubernetes is &lt;a href="https://helm.sh/"&gt;Helm.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful tool for sure, but
it uses Go templates, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the most intuitive syntax. On top of
that, there are some weird decisions made by the developers of the tool &amp;mdash;
semantic versioning is a requirement for chart versions, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes, the container orchestrator!</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/extra/notes/kubernetes/kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/extra/notes/kubernetes/kubernetes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Kubernetes for a while now, and while the name made it seem a
little daunting at first, it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite simple. In fact it&amp;rsquo;s simple
enough I got Kubernetes certified recently! If I can do it, anyone can. This
page has a few notes on interesting Kubernetes tricks I&amp;rsquo;ve learned during my
time working with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-container-orchestration"&gt;What is container orchestration?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s unclear. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s not unclear, but the words &amp;ldquo;container orchestration&amp;rdquo;
don&amp;rsquo;t really mean anything. To summarize Kubernetes, it&amp;rsquo;s an aggregate of
container runtimes operating on multiple machines &amp;mdash; which we call &lt;em&gt;nodes&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash;
that host containerized processes grouped together in what we refer to as
&lt;em&gt;Pods.&lt;/em&gt; The two main roles Kubernetes plays are:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How does a micro form factor PC perform?</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/using-a-micro-pc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/using-a-micro-pc/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, I started looking into building myself a reasonable desktop
so I could finally graduate from my ThinkPad X220. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, the X220
is pretty neat and will still work for a long time, but sometimes its fan would
go turbo mode while running relatively simple programs like Telegram Desktop
and Discord. You could chalk that up to the applications not being well
optimized &lt;em&gt;&amp;mdash; and that is specially true for the latter example &amp;mdash;&lt;/em&gt; but at
some point you give in and start looking to replace the hardware that was
already meant for just office work &lt;strong&gt;when it came out back in 2011.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Some of my thoughts on The Legend of Zelda</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/thoughts-on-zelda-games/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/thoughts-on-zelda-games/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;rsquo;t spend a lot of my time playing video games, there are a few
franchises that will compell me to spend some of my spare hours in front of a
screen (or two). For the most part they are Nintendo franchises, but they also
feature &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Puyo Puyo Tetris.&lt;/em&gt; The series that never fails to
draw me in, however, is &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda,&lt;/em&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about
briefly in this article.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using Git outside of programming</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/git-outside-programming/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/git-outside-programming/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It is public knowledge that versioning is important when writing documents, be
it source code for a project written in a programming language, drafts of a
book, or meeting minutes. GitHub, for instance, uses Git for their &lt;em&gt;site
policy, documentation,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;roadmap,&lt;/em&gt; none of which involve or focus on
programming. But what if we don&amp;rsquo;t care too much about versioning itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping a history of versions of a piece of work doesn&amp;rsquo;t come to mind so
naturally, especially for those of us who don&amp;rsquo;t want to show whatever we&amp;rsquo;re
working on to anybody until we&amp;rsquo;re perfectly happy with it. We forget that the
history being preserved serves us far more than it does anybody else: did you
come up with a good idea for working around X limitation? &lt;em&gt;Write it down!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On linear history with Git: rebase, merge, squash</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/git-rebase-vs-merge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/git-rebase-vs-merge/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/strong&gt; I do not claim to be an expert on Git, nor do I claim to have a
lot of experience in source code management tools. This article is being
written as I decide what I want for my own projects, and how I position myself
on the application of each &amp;ldquo;philosophy&amp;rdquo;, so to speak. This topic is
controversial in ways I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even imagined before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; Decent knowledge of Git and its terminology is assumed here. Some
commands might be shown, but explanations about what a &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;branch&lt;/code&gt;,
etc. are will not be present. Links to documentation will be added on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Experiences with CI/CD and DevOps</title><link>https://d3adb5.net/blog/experiences-with-ci-cd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d3adb5.net/blog/experiences-with-ci-cd/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; This became such a lengthy article despite the relative lack of
detail that it forced me to include a table of contents. Hopefully it isn&amp;rsquo;t too
tiresome to read through, and whoever reads it can jump to whatever topic might
interest them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this blogpost is to give the reader an overview of what it was like
for me to get accustomed to and implement some &lt;em&gt;continuous integration (CI)&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;continuous deployment (CD)&lt;/em&gt; solutions to my own personal projects. It was and
is still being a bumpy ride, but it&amp;rsquo;s more gratifying than I thought it would be
when I first started.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
