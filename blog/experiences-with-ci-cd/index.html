detail that it forced me to include a table of contents. Hopefully it isn&rsquo;t too
tiresome to read through, and whoever reads it can jump to whatever topic might
interest them.</p><p>The goal of this blogpost is to give the reader an overview of what it was like
for me to get accustomed to and implement some <em>continuous integration (CI)</em> and
<em>continuous deployment (CD)</em> solutions to my own personal projects. It was and
is still being a bumpy ride, but it&rsquo;s more gratifying than I thought it would be
when I first started.</p><p>My general attitude towards CI/CD services, programs, platforms, and the like
was that they were &ldquo;simply not for me,&rdquo; and something only big projects or
companies, led by a highly qualified work force, would really need and benefit
from.</p><p>That position has, of course, changed since then as working with improving the
software development lifecycle first hand made me realize just how much sense it
all makes. I now crave to bring automated tests, code reviews, constant pull
requests, and automated deployment to all of my personal projects. It is a great
way to define and guarantee a standard of quality.</p><h2 id=humble-beginnings-git-hooks--gnu-make>Humble beginnings: Git hooks & GNU Make</h2><p>The first software development pipeline &mdash; if you can even call it that &mdash; I
devised was a combination of Git, Bash, and GNU Make, the latter gluing together
programs like <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> and <code>rsync</code>. Its goal was to automate deploying my
personal website.</p><p>Git was used to version the source files, GNU Make was used to simplify the
build and deployment processes into <code>make</code> and <code>make deploy</code>, Hugo was used to
turn Markdown + templates into HTML/CSS, and <code>rsync</code> was used to copy the
generated static pages to the web root &mdash; <code>/var/www</code>.</p><p>To turn a <code>git push</code> into the only command necessary to trigger a build and
deploy the new content, <a href=https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#post-receive>a <code>post-receive</code> Git hook</a> was set up on a
bare repository hosted on the VPS that served the website. The hook was nothing
more than a shell script, which was roughly:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>cd /path/to/the/worktree        <span style=color:#75715e># go to a clone of the repo</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>git fetch origin                <span style=color:#75715e># fetch the new commits</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>git reset --hard origin/master  <span style=color:#75715e># sync up with the master branch</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>make <span style=color:#f92672>&amp;&amp;</span> make deploy             <span style=color:#75715e># build and deploy pages</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As long as all permissions were properly set and dependencies were met, this
meant all I realistically had to do to update the pages on my website was edit
the files locally, create new commits, and push them to the remote. If any
errors occurred, I was able to see them in the output of <code>git push</code>, since it
displays the output of Git hooks as they&rsquo;re executed.</p><h3 id=why-this-lacks-continuous-integration>Why this lacks Continuous Integration</h3><p>As happy as I was with my new discovery (namely Git hooks) and my setup, looking
back on it I cannot say it featured CI. Before my reasons for thinking so are
outlined, the following is the definition of Continuous Integration given by
<a href=https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration>Atlassian</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of
code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It&rsquo;s a
primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code
changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run.</p></blockquote><p>I believe CI can be achieved even when there&rsquo;s a single contributor, but if you
disagree with me, add that to the following list of reasons why I don&rsquo;t think
what I was up to was continous integration.</p><p><strong>Reason #1:</strong> There was always a single branch &mdash; <code>master</code> &mdash; so changes
being tested had already been integrated.</p><p>The point of CI is to test and review changes before they make their way to
their target branch. That&rsquo;s why a suite like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and so
on is so useful: they all materialize the proposal of changes into pull (or
merge) requests. These requests can be denied, accepted, reviewed, etc., and the
coolest thing is that when they&rsquo;re created or changes are made to them, these
suites can let us know so programmatically through webhooks, and even handle the
events themselves natively.</p><p>In my case, there were no pull requests: commits were added to <code>master</code> and
pushed <strong>directly upstream,</strong> no questions asked.</p><p><strong>Reason #2:</strong> The only test being performed is deployment.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no automated testing of any kind, not even to see if the static pages
can still be generated. I can even recall some times I broke the static page
generation by experimenting with Hugo&rsquo;s layout capabilities &mdash; the version of
Hugo installed on my machine and on the remote host were different.</p><p>The lack of a reproducible environment for testing (and obviously the tests
themselves) meant the risk of breaking production was taken every time a
deployment was performed.</p><p><strong>Reason #3:</strong> Changes didn&rsquo;t undergo any review processes.</p><p>For many people, code review isn&rsquo;t necessarily within the scope of continous
integration, but in my humble opinion, it is central to it. If CI is about
controlling or ensuring a degree of quality before any changes are merged into
stable branches, reviews are perfectly aligned with it, and sit in the way of
integration.</p><p>I said before that <em>I believe CI can be achieved even when there&rsquo;s a single
contributor,</em> so why do I bring up this point? That&rsquo;s because I simply didn&rsquo;t
review my own changes. I tested them locally, sure, but I didn&rsquo;t review them
with &ldquo;impartial eyes&rdquo; after development. The lack of any manner of review
process, to me, makes it unfit for the moniker of Continuous Integration.</p><h3 id=how-it-might-have-continuous-deployment>How it might have Continuous Deployment</h3><p>If you squint hard enough, or if you&rsquo;re permissive in the coupling of CI and CD,
the Git hook setup did feature continuous deployment. Once more, we&rsquo;ll start
with a definition. This time, it comes from <a href=https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/continuous-deployment>TechTarget:</a></p><blockquote><p>Continuous Deployment (CD) is a strategy for software releases wherein any
code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released
into the production environment, making changes that are visible to the
software&rsquo;s users.</p></blockquote><p>Commits that reached the <code>master</code> branch, used for production in our situation,
would automatically make their way to production &mdash; the website as it was
served by my VPS. In that sense, this is an example of continuous deployment,
but <em>if there&rsquo;s no CI, can there be CD?</em> Is the &ldquo;automated testing phase&rdquo;
necessary to constitute continuous deployment?</p><p>Myself, I&rsquo;d say no. While both are fundamental premises for DevOps, setting up
CI and CD is often done separately. Were the two truly codependent, we&rsquo;d
probably have a single term for the entire process that specifically addressed
both practices.</p><h2 id=the-road-to-proper-cicd>The road to proper CI/CD</h2><p>My eyes were opened to CI/CD when I started working. Up until then I didn&rsquo;t
really know what the terms meant, if I&rsquo;d heard them at all. To me, CI was the
latter part of the name for <a href=https://travis-ci.com>Travis CI</a>, a tool that ran some
automated builds on the XMonad repository, and CD was an optical media format.</p><p>Then I started working and came into contact with <a href=https://jenkins.io>Jenkins</a>. It was
presented to me as the CI/CD tool of choice for most people, and I can tell why.
It feels incredibly hacked together, however, and very resource hungry. Despite
that, with gleeming eyes gazing at a newfound appreciation for software
development, I vowed to write some <code>Jenkinsfile</code>s for my own purposes.</p><p>Soon after setting up my first couple of repositories and reading through
Jenkins&rsquo; documentation, thinking &ldquo;man, this took some effort to set up, but
it&rsquo;ll pay off,&rdquo; my attention shifted to <a href=https://github.com/actions>GitHub Actions</a>. With just
a few lines of YAML and reading through documentation, a workflow was set up,
and work could start on another. GitHub would handle everything natively, and
run it all for free as long as the repository remained public or I didn&rsquo;t go
over my minutes-per-month limit.</p><h3 id=why-i-dont-like-using-jenkins-unless-i-have-to>Why I don&rsquo;t like using Jenkins unless I have to</h3><p>This is a shortened example of an average <code>Jenkinsfile</code> using the declarative
pipeline syntax:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-groovy data-lang=groovy><span style=display:flex><span>pipeline <span style=color:#f92672>{</span>

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>  <span style=color:#f92672>}</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#f92672>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The options usually span multiple lines, as does the agent specification and the
parameters, if this is a parameterized pipeline. On top of that, a pipeline with
a single stage is a rare thing, so replicate the one stage in the file above,
keeping in mind it&rsquo;ll definitely have more than one step. Moreover, suppose the
<code>when</code> clause will be made necessary for subsequent stages, and you have
yourself unnecessary levels of indentation and line numbers.</p><p>It&rsquo;s just so tiresome. Sometimes necessary, I&rsquo;ll give Jenkins that, but so
tiresome.</p><p>Finally, remember that when setting up Jenkins you&rsquo;ll probably have to set up
Jenkins agents, be it dynamically provisioned through a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; or set up once
and maintained. Good luck managing dependencies, I just hope there are enough
<a href=https://docker.com>Docker</a> images for what you need and you don&rsquo;t have to spin up a
certain repository manager.</p><p><em>One last thing:</em> are you going to need plugins? Here&rsquo;s hoping they&rsquo;re well
maintained and don&rsquo;t break in newer versions.</p><h3 id=github-actions-just-saves-time-and-money>GitHub Actions just saves time and money</h3><p>Jenkins relies on plugins for its integration with suites like GitHub, GitLab,
Bitbucket, etc. You&rsquo;ll also have to set up webhooks unless you like polling for
updates periodically. All these platforms are smart enough to cash in on
companies implementing CI/CD while hosting their repositories there, and provide
their own solutions to make the integration painless, or just unnecessary.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/actions>GitHub Actions</a> is an example of such a service. It&rsquo;s free for
public repositories as of the time of this writing, and you get 2000 minutes per
month for free for private repositories on a basic account. Want to skip setting
up Jenkins, the plugin, the webhook, the <code>Jenkinsfile</code>, and run <code>make</code> for every
pull request? This is enough:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#f92672>on</span>: <span style=color:#ae81ff>pull_request</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>More intricate workflows will necessitate more lines, of course, perhaps even
more jobs, which are run in parallel unless inter-job dependencies are
explicitly stated. On top of that, you don&rsquo;t have to pay a dime if you use
self-hosted runners for your runs, so you still have the option to set up your
own infrastructure for CI/CD while using GitHub Actions.</p><p>That&rsquo;s enough praise for GitHub Actions. I&rsquo;m not sponsored by them, but the
point is I quite like it.</p><h3 id=picking-a-project-tools-and-workflow>Picking a project, tools, and workflow</h3><p>There is no better way to learn than the hard way, and the hard way usually
means plunging into open sea when you barely know how to swim. <em>Metaphorically,</em>
of course; don&rsquo;t go doing that or you will most likely drown. In my situation,
that means picking the tools I want to work with after some consideration,
picking a project I think would benefit from them, and devising and implementing
a workflow that works for me.</p><p>The project chosen was automating server setup, configuration and deployment of
services based on a list and few other parameters. The goal is to be able to
almost entirely recreate a server from scratch if need be.</p><p>The tools picked were:</p><ul><li><em>Git</em> for version control, for obvious reasons.</li><li><em>Docker</em> for the services, primarily using <em>Compose</em> files.</li><li><em>Ansible</em> for server setup, due to idempotency and, well, because I wanted to
pick it up.</li><li><em>GitHub Actions</em> for the CI/CD workflows, for reasons already outlined.</li></ul><p>Finally, the workflow I wanted was similar to what I achieved with the Git hook
of years prior, with a couple of key differences: changes would all have to go
through <em>pull requests</em>, which in turn trigger <em>CI runs</em>, that run Ansible in
check mode; finally, the <em>CD runs</em> are triggered by merges into <code>master</code>.</p><figure><a href=/media/git-ansible-sketch.png><img src=/media/git-ansible-sketch.png alt="Rough sketch of what I wanted, from git commit to production."></a><figcaption><p>Rough sketch of what I wanted, from <code>git commit</code> to production.</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=picking-up-ansible>Picking up Ansible</h2><p><a href=https://ansible.com/>Ansible</a> was presented to me at one point a few years ago, but I
shrugged it off completely. At the time I had only one VPS, and I was using it
as a mail server on top of hosting my website and other simple services such as
<a href=https://syncplay.pl>Syncplay</a>. It was hardly tempting to learn how to set it all up again
from scratch, as that wasn&rsquo;t going to happen anytime soon.</p><p>Now, years later, I&rsquo;m no longer maintaining the cumbersome mail server setup,
and my website is hosted on GitHub Pages, so I&rsquo;m free to experiment with the
VPS<em>es</em> as much as I want &mdash; none of them come with an uptime requirement.</p><p>The thing I didn&rsquo;t know back then that really made Ansible stand out is its goal
to be <em>idempotent:</em> to converge into a desired state and remain there even when
the playbooks are applied again and again. A worthy goal, but also one that
would bring with it some difficulties.</p><h3 id=modules-are-a-barrier-to-entry-in-a-way>Modules are a barrier to entry, in a way</h3><p>One thing that is a bit of a barrier to entry in Ansible is the fact that tasks
rely on <em>Ansible modules</em>, some of which are built-in, some of which are
provided in the &ldquo;core&rdquo;, some of which are provided by third party &ldquo;galaxies&rdquo; or
whatever they&rsquo;re called.</p><p>When it comes to picking up a programming or markup language, all you really
need to learn is the general syntax, the core concepts, the first class members,
and so on. Ansible uses YAML, and after understanding the notion of a <em>task</em>, a
<em>play</em>, a <em>playbook</em>, a <em>handler</em>, a <em>variable</em>, a <em>role</em>, you&rsquo;re sort of left
on your own to explore available modules.</p><p>This is not meant as a harsh critique of Ansible &mdash; I quite like it, after all
&mdash; but it does make it feel more difficult to immediately convert the concepts
you just learned into practice. <em>I know what a play is, and I&rsquo;m about to write
my first playbook, but&mldr; how do I make Ansible ensure some line is present in a
file?</em> In reading about those concepts, you&rsquo;re not even once shown there is a
<a href=https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/lineinfile_module.html>built-in module called <code>lineinfile</code></a>.</p><p>Can you use Ansible without any knowledge of its available modules? Of course!
If you know some shell scripting, you can write plays with tasks that are no
different from any old Bash script. To ensure some file has the right ownership,
for example, you can use the <code>chown</code> program, and write a task using the <code>shell</code>
module:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span style=display:flex><span>- <span style=color:#f92672>name</span>: <span style=color:#ae81ff>Ensure /tmp/hippopotamus is owned by Max</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>  <span style=color:#f92672>shell</span>: <span style=color:#ae81ff>chown max:max /tmp/hippopotamus</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It works, but the disadvantage of such a task is that Ansible is unaware of its
purpose, consequences, or context, and so it can only run the script every time
without knowing whether or not the <em>desired state</em> is achieved. That is, after
all, the whole point of Ansible: <em>idempotency</em>, i.e. to converge to a desired
state and remain there no matter how many times the tasks are executed.</p><p>The only way to give Ansible this sort of awareness is by using a more specific
module. In this case one that handles generic operations on files, rather than
the one that runs generic shell scripts. We can achieve what we want with the
<a href=https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/file_module.html>built-in <code>file</code> module:</a></p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span style=display:flex><span>- <span style=color:#f92672>name</span>: <span style=color:#ae81ff>Ensure /tmp/hippopotamus is owned by Max</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>  <span style=color:#f92672>file</span>:
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    <span style=color:#f92672>path</span>: <span style=color:#ae81ff>/tmp/hippopotamus</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    <span style=color:#f92672>owner</span>: <span style=color:#ae81ff>max</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    <span style=color:#f92672>group</span>: <span style=color:#ae81ff>max</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This way, if the file is owned by someone else, its ownership will be changed to
<code>max:max</code>, and Ansible will report <em>changes</em> were made. If the file is already
owned by <code>max:max</code>, Ansible will report the task&rsquo;s status as <em>ok</em> (no changes
were necessary).</p><p>With the <code>shell</code> example, Ansible would <em>always</em> report changes were made, since
it can&rsquo;t know whether the script had to make changes or not, nor if it actually
did, only that it had to run the script. You can force Ansible not to report
changes, or to report changes on the task based on a condition, through the
<code>changed_when</code> key:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span style=display:flex><span>- <span style=color:#f92672>name</span>: <span style=color:#ae81ff>Ensure /tmp/hippopotamus is owned by Max</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>  <span style=color:#f92672>shell</span>: <span style=color:#ae81ff>chown max:max /tmp/hippopotamus</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>  <span style=color:#f92672>changed_when</span>: <span style=color:#66d9ef>false</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that the same is true for the <a href=https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/command_module.html>built-in <code>command</code> module,</a>,
which differs from <code>shell</code> in the sense that it invokes the command directly,
while <code>shell</code> forwards its contents to something like <code>/bin/bash</code>. Effectively,
<code>shell</code> lets us write scripts in our playbooks.</p><p>All in all, I find myself often looking up <em>how to do X in Ansible,</em> since I
can&rsquo;t be bothered to read through more than a few pages listing modules
available for use. The day I decide to do so, the plays in my repositories will
likely all be rewritten from scratch. In the end, learning Ansible is akin to
expanding one&rsquo;s vocabulary in a different <em>human</em> language: practice is pretty
much necessary.</p><h3 id=what-it-was-like-to-put-into-practice>What it was like to put into practice</h3><p>In the end, I wrote multiple playbooks, some of which were made public and some
of which remain private since they contain some information I&rsquo;d rather keep
private for the time being. A brief summary:</p><ul><li>A playbook to bootstrap hosts with essential configuration;</li><li>A playbook to sync users with the target host;</li><li>A playbook to ensure some essential tools are installed;</li><li>A playbook to bring up or down services as specified for each host.</li></ul><p>At times I had to draw inspiration from Ansible roles available online. I never
truly wanted to use them, especially since they either did much more than I
wanted, or didn&rsquo;t have support for specifically what I wanted. It was quite the
learning experience, but the best thing I can say came out of it was learning
how to use the <code>ansible-doc</code> command.</p><p>One thing I wish could change &mdash; and I hope to one day stop being too lazy to
create my own Ansible modules &mdash; is my reliance on tasks that use the <code>stat</code>
module being used to decide whether to skip further tasks. If statements, which
this is an equivalent of, are not pretty in Ansible, even if they get the job
done and allow us to achieve idempotency. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;cheap idempotency,&rdquo; if you will.</p><h2 id=gitops-what-it-is-and-why>GitOps, what it is and why</h2><p>There&rsquo;s plenty I could write on the other tools I chose to use and the way I
used them, but this article has extended itself enough. More articles are to
come explaining and / or teaching how to do this or that with the tools I&rsquo;ve
managed to familiarize myself with over time.</p><p>What I can say has been a bit of a goal and motivation for me is what
<a href=https://www.weave.works/blog/what-is-gitops-really>WeaveWorks</a> decided to call GitOps; a workflow &mdash;
philosophy, some would say &mdash; summarized by &ldquo;a Git repository should be the
single source of truth.&rdquo; There are plenty of candidates for a proper definition,
but this should suffice:</p><blockquote><p>A Git repository is the single source of truth for the desired state of the
whole system. This desired state is described declaratively, while convergence
mechanisms are put in place to ensure the desired state is reached.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, <em>changes in configuration</em> equate to <em>pull requests</em> in a GitOps
workflow.</p><p>Take <em>configuration</em> here to mean the state of a system, not just configuration
files and the like, that different pieces of software use to alter their
behavior. Exclude from this whatever persistent data is produced by the use of
the system &mdash; which hopefully won&rsquo;t actually affect its general behavior, as
determinism makes software a little unpredictable, or at the very least
unmanageable.</p><p>While this approach to deployment might come with its own shortcomings or
eventually fall out of fashion for one reason or another, it does provide
relative <em>agility</em>, going hand in hand with DevOps culture and agile development
methodologies.</p><h3 id=how-i-think-i-achieved-it-with-my-current-setup>How I think I achieved it with my current setup</h3><p>WeaveWorks coined the term in describing a workflow surrounding
<a href=https://kubernetes.io>Kubernetes</a>. It makes a lot of sense to speak of declarative descriptions
of the intended state of the system, considering Kubernetes objects all have
what we call YAML manifests to them. Though there are certain properties under
<code>{.status}</code> that only exist when the object itself is up and &ldquo;running,&rdquo; objects
are for the most part equal to the YAML manifests that generated them.</p><p>Without something like Kubernetes, it is really possible to award a workflow the
name <em>GitOps?</em> If you think about it, and obviously keep an open mind for this,
as long as you can declare the state of your &ldquo;target&rdquo; instead of outlining a
series of instructions to perform &mdash; it is debatable whether Ansible meets the
criteria, considering order is more than relevant &mdash; and you have convergence
mechanisms put in place, you <em>should</em> be.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say that despite Ansible&rsquo;s heavy reliance on the order of the changes it
needs to perform, and the lack of seamless dependency management &mdash; how would
Ansible know that <code>certbot</code>, the package, needs to be installed for <code>cerbot</code>,
the tool, to be used? &mdash; is no reason why we can&rsquo;t call playbooks a declarative
specification for how we want our hosts to be. <em>In that case,</em> it is perfectly
fine to say that a workflow that uses Ansible for converging to a desired state
constitutes GitOps.</p><p>I believe we can leave out the parts of the system&rsquo;s state that aren&rsquo;t managed
by Ansible, since these &ldquo;unmanaged parts&rdquo; are also part of workflows surrounding
Kubernetes (think of the contents of <code>PersistentVolume</code> objects, or
authentication with the cluster). Let&rsquo;s just be happy that <em>we can say a <code>git commit</code> is the only change we truly need,</em> and rejoice in the simplicity of our
CI/CD setups.</p></article></main><footer id=page-footer><p id=commit><a href=https://github.com/d3adb5/website/commit/538f1828a225229364fac663e3a9549e8db8e1d9><span class=commit-hash>538f182</span><span class=commit-subject>feat: add tags to existing blog posts</span></a></p><p id=timestamp>Updated May 14, 2023</p></footer></body></html>
