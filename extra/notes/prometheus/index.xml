alerting, especially in the cloud-native world. It aids in fetching, storing,
and querying metrics from a variety of sources, and can be used to trigger
alerts when certain conditions are met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fancy words, what is it, really?&lt;/em&gt; You can imagine Prometheus as the annoying
little brother or cousing who periodically hits you with the same question, in
anticipation for when you&amp;rsquo;re going out, playing video games, or preparing food.
In this case, this annoying rugrat is asking &amp;ldquo;how much memory are you using?&amp;rdquo;,
&amp;ldquo;how many requests are you getting?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;how many threads are you running?&amp;rdquo;, and
so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
