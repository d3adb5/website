personal website

This repository houses both the source and generated files for my personal
website. It's not meant to serve as a CV or a portfolio, it's just a static
website like any other. Or so I intend for it to be as of the time of this
writing.

It uses Hugo, a static site generator written in Go. A long time ago I wrote a
few shell and python scripts to generate the HTML that would be served for my
website. It was pretty messy, and after creating template after template and
excitedly speaking of it to people on IRC, I was pointed to static site
generators.

For the longest time, I had Makefiles to convert things like SASS to CSS and
place the generated files in Hugo's static directory. Now I'm trying to use Hugo
Pipes. Forgive the old man in me for using POSIX sh, Python and GNU Make in the
past. You can't teach an old dog new tricks, so I guess this means I'm not an
old dog.
